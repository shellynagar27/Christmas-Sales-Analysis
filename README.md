## Dataset
The dataset originates from a leading market research firm that collected detailed data on holiday sales, including customer demographics, purchase behaviors, promotional effectiveness, and satisfaction metrics. 

The objective of this analysis is to uncover insights into consumer shopping habits during Christmas, explore the impact of promotions, identify key drivers of satisfaction, and optimize future holiday strategies.

## Key Questions Addressed
This Power BI report aims to answer the following questions:

1. How do **sales volumes fluctuate during Christmas compared to other periods**?
2. What are the **age and gender distributions of customers making Christmas purchases**?
3. Which **regions or cities show the highest sales volumes during Christmas**, and how do these trends compare to non-Christmas periods?
4. What is the **effect of promotions on sales during Christmas**? Are specific promotions more effective than others?
5. Which **products are most popular during Christmas**, and how do these preferences vary by age, gender, or location?
6. How do **customer satisfaction scores differ for Christmas purchases compared to non-Christmas transactions**?
7. What **percentage of orders during Christmas include gift wrapping**, and which demographics are most likely to use this service?
8. Are **express shipping options more popular during Christmas**? How does delivery time correlate with customer satisfaction?
9. What are the **main reasons for product returns during Christmas**, and do these differ from returns during other periods?
10. How do **weather conditions (e.g., snowy, sunny) or specific Christmas events (e.g., "Christmas Market") influence sales and customer behavior**?

## Data Preparation
The dataset comprises two tables:
- **Main Dataset** â€“ Contains transactional and customer-related data
- **Data Dictionary** â€“ Provides metadata descriptions for the dataset

Additionally, the following supplementary tables were created to enhance analysis:
- **Measure Table** â€“ Stores all calculated measures
- **Dim_Date Table** â€“ For date-based analysis
- **Time Bin Table** â€“ Categorizes time into Morning, Late Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Exploration** â€“ Understanding dataset structure and contents
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Removing extra whitespaces and duplicates
3. **Data Transformation & Formatting** â€“ Ensuring proper data types, creating the Dim_Date table
4. **Data Modeling** â€“ Establishing relationships between Fact Table and Dim_Date table
5. **Measure Creation & Visualization** â€“ Developing necessary metrics and dashboards to address key questions
6. **Interactivity Enhancements** â€“ Adding slicers for better user control, including a restore button
7. **Navigation & Usability** â€“ Creating an information page to guide users through charts and filters
